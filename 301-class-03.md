# Passing Functions as Props

## Lists and Keys
- What does .map() return?
.map will usually return a value that will intake an array then placed to a variable as shown in this example:
```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = numbers.map((number) => number * 2);
console.log(doubled);
```
