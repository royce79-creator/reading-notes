# Passing Functions as Props

[React Docs - Lists and Keys](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)
## Lists and Keys

1.  What does .map() return?
- This method would return a new array of values depending on what the variable that is being used with the dot notation.
.map will usually return a value that will intake an array then placed to a variable as shown in this example:
```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = numbers.map((number) => number * 2);
console.log(doubled);
```

2. If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?
- You would want to make a function that would be able to use the map() method in oder to do this. for example: 
```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
  <li>{number}</li>
);
```
You would have to make sure to render to the DOM as well.
3. Each list item needs a unique ____.
- Id's that will be specifically pertaining to amongst the siblings.
4. What is the purpose of a key?
- A key is aspecial string attribute, it helps React identify which items have changed, added, or removed. Gives the elements a stable identity.

[The Spread Operator](https://medium.com/coding-at-dawn/how-to-use-the-spread-operator-in-javascript-b9e4a8b06fab)
## The Spread Operator

1. What is the spread operator?
- Expands the iterable object into a list of arguments.
2. List 4 things that the spread operator can do.
- Copy an Array, can be used for math functions, adding an item to a list, and combining objects
3. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.
- Here is an example where two arrays can be combined using spread.
```
const animeChar = ['Luffy','Naruto','Goku','Deku']
const moreAnimeChar = [...animeChar];
console.log(moreAnimeChar);
animeChar[0] = 'All Might'
console.log(...[...animeChar,...moreAnimeChar])
// Expected result: ['All Might','Naruto','Goku','Deku','Luffy','Naruto','Goku','Deku']
```
4. Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.
- The example above shows that you can add a new item as well to an array.
5. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.
- An example of combining two objects:
```
const pokemonTypes = {first: "fire, water, grass"}
const morePokemonTypes = {second: "psychic, steel, bug"}

const allPokemonTypes = {...pokemonTypes,...morePokemonTypes}
console.log(allPokemonTypes); 
//What the object should look like: { first: "fire, water, grass", second: "psychic, steel, bug" }
```
[How to Pass Functions Between Components](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c05OL7XbwXU)
## Passing Functions Between Components
1. In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?
- They end up importing the parent component to the child component to be able to communicate between components. they also use a key word "this." in order to pass through information.
2. In your own words, what does the increment function do?
- The increment function basically allows the number for person.js to increase the amount of people are added by the user when using theon click button.
3. How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?
- You would need to use props as a way to bring a mehtod into a child component.
4. How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?
- From what I can gather it looks like you would need to reference (ref="child") using it basically by putting the component name into the return as well.
