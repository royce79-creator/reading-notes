# Javascript
## How does Javascript fit in? 
- Javascript is the behavior of a website and how it will interact with the user interface. 
- You do HTML first to start the structure, then CSS in order to bring a good presentation and fianlly javascript to enhance the uasability of the site as a whole. (brings it to life.) 
- Javascript can be used for loops that help with functions that are needed to make certain interactions work with your site. 
- With the example that was replicated on the book, we were able to make a script that would allow the time of day to effect what the greeting said whther or not it would say good afternoon, good morning, or good evening.
