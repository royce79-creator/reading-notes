## Game Of Greed 2
- Python Scope

- The concept of scope rules how variables and names are looked up in your code. It determines the visibility of a variable within the code.
- *LEGB* stands for *Local*, *Enclosing*, *Global*, and *Built-in* scopes.

## Understanding Scope 
Examples of scope: 
1. Global scope: The names that you define in this scope are available to all your code.
2. Local scope: The names that you define in this scope are only available or visible to the code within the scope.

- Python uses the location of the name assignment or definition to associate it with a particular scope. In other words, where you assign or define a name in your code determines the scope or visibility of that name.

- In Python, the concept of scope is closely related to the concept of the namespace. As you’ve learned so far, a Python scope determines where in your program a name is visible. Python scopes are implemented as dictionaries that map names to objects. These dictionaries are commonly called namespaces. These are the concrete mechanisms that Python uses to store names. They’re stored in a special attribute called .__dict__.

- Scope will alwasy be something that is important to refactor due to so many naming convetions that could be used in the code. Always ensure that order is thought of.
