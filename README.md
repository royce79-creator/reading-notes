## Growth Mindset

ðŸ’¯ What is a growth mindset? Well it's a state of mind that allows you to be teachable through working through frustrations, failure, and challenges. Overall, I beleive that having a focude mind set on the end goal and maing attainable goals along the way keeps you in state of mind that will allow you to keep yourself in a growth mindset. Facing those hard challenges head on instead of giving up is ideally getting your mind to grow with wisdom and knowledge that can solidify growth. Things I plan on doing to keep myself in this growth mindset is to reflect on my days and see what I could have done better. Second, seek help when I don't understand something and use resources and peers alike to find the answers. Finally, Making concrete goals for myeself that I can achieve in weekly to monthly timelines.

### Basketball's a lifestyle
When I want to take a break from coding I love to play some basketball. It just allows you to burn a whole lot of calories but also centers your mind by having you think of something else. Below is an image link to a ball swishing into a net. Probably the most ASMR like sound you can get.
