## What is a file?

### Files on most modern file systems are composed of three main parts:

1. Header: metadata about the contents of the file (file name, size, type, and so on)
2. Data: contents of the file as written by the creator or editor
3. End of file (EOF): special character that indicates the end of the file

- When you access a file on an operating system, a file path is required. The file path is a string that represents the location of a file. Itâ€™s broken up into three major parts:

1. Folder Path: the file folder location on the file system where subsequent folders are separated by a forward slash / (Unix) or backslash \ (Windows)
2. File Name: the actual name of the file
3. Extension: the end of the file path pre-pended with a period (.) used to indicate the file type

Text file types: 

```
open('abc.txt')

open('abc.txt', 'r')

open('abc.txt', 'w')
```
