# Reading Notes 9

## Chapter 7 & 14 (forms)
- Whenever you want to collect information from
visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a
```<form>``` element.
- Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.
- Each form control is given a name, and the text the
user types in or the values of the options they select
are sent to the server.
- HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it
easier for visitors to fill in forms.

## More Notes
- In addition to the CSS properties covered in other
chapters which work with the contents of all elements,
there are several others that are specifically used to
control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms.
- List markers can be given different appearances
using the list-style-type and list-style image
properties.
- Table cells can have different borders and spacing in
different browsers, but there are properties you can
use to control them and make them more consistent.
- Forms are easier to use if the form controls are
vertically aligned using CSS.
- Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more
interactive.

## Chapter 6 Events(pg 243-292)
- An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.

- Here are some examples of HTML events:

- An HTML web page has finished loading
- An HTML input field was changed
- An HTML button was clicked
- Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.

JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.
HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.
