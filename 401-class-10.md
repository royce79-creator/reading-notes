## Stacks & Queues
- Stack data structures consist of Nodes. Every Node will reference the next Node but not the previous.

**Common Terminology for Stacks**

1. *push* -> Nodes or items that are put into the stack are *pushed*
2. *pop* -> Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are *popped*, Exception -> When Node is empty
3. *top* -> This is the top of the stack.
4. *peek* -> When you use peek this will veiw the value of the top Node in the stack, Exception -> When Node is Empty
5. *isEmpty* -> returns true when the stack is empty otherwise returns false.

- FILO -> First in last out
- LIFO -> Last in first out

## What is a Queue?

1. *Enqueue* -> Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
2. *Dequeue* -> Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
3. *Front* -> This is the front/first Node of the queue.
4. *Rear* -> This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
5. *Peek* -> When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
6. *IsEmpty* -> returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.

- FIFO -> First In First Out
- LILO -> Last In Last Out
