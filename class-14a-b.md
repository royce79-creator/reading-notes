## CSS Transforms
- Looking thru transforming figures I see using CSS figures you can utlize certain elements like (transform) ==> using degrees or px.
- Can be sued with 3D or 2D translation. Using the z-axis when it coems to 3D models, this can help with making a cube for example.

## CSS Animations
- This wil look closely at images that would move across the screen in a certain way.
- Some good things to know with animations is that it alters the wya a box can look like, there is also the fact that.
- Transition timing is one that looks at the duration at which the image or box is going to be transitioning from one shape/color into another.

## Simple CSS3 Transitions
- Change color: 
```
.color:hover
{
        background:#53a7ea;
}
```
- Fade in:
```
.fade
{
        opacity:0.5;
}
.fade:hover
{
        opacity:1;
}
```
- Shrink & Grow:
```
.grow:hover
{
        -webkit-transform: scale(1.3);
        -ms-transform: scale(1.3);
        transform: scale(1.3);
}
```
```
.shrink:hover
{
        -webkit-transform: scale(0.8);
        -ms-transform: scale(0.8);
        transform: scale(0.8);
}
```
