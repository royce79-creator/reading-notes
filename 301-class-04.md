# React and Forms

1. What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
A controlled component is a form that would be maniupilated by the user where they can make changes to it but is controlled within React.

2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
It will update as the user is inputting the keystrokes value since it updates in real time and is changing the react state.

3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
Using the {this.state.value} will help with making sure to have the text that is placed into text field to be altered based off the what a usewr can place into the text field.

### Handling Mutliple Inputs
1. Why would we use a ternary operator?

2. Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:
```
  x===y ? value if true : value if false
  if(x===y){
 console.log(true);
  } else {
 console.log(false);
  }
  Rewrite
  x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false);
```

### Extra Notes
1. The condition is what you’re actually testing. The result of your condition should be true or false or at least coerce to either boolean value.
2. A ? separates our conditional from our true value. Anything between the ? and the : is what is executed if the condition evaluates to true.
3. Finally a : colon. If your condition evaluates to false, any code after the colon is executed.
