# Thinking in React

[Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)

1. How would you break a mock into a component heirarchy?
- First thing I would break up would be the actual Mock would have to be developing what components are what are in the Mock like the Form, list items, and the items that are displayed on the component.

2. What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?
- A single principle should be one thing that can function the site, if it get bigger then breaking it into sub-components is the way to go. 

3. What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?
- Building a static version of the application will show you the data flor from the top down for now. will not need state though since you will be unable to 

4. Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?
- Having a static applciation give you what the data flow will look like but then after you would want to know how the UI state will be manipulated. The key here is to keep it as dry as possible.

5. What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?
- Is it passed in from a pareent via props? 
- Does it remain unchanged over time?
- Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component?

6. How can you identify where state needs to live?
- You would want to place state in a component that would need to filter and show a boolean value to show something on the page, for example, like with the example in the reading this state woud live in the product table due to the fact that it is where the user can change what the page displays.

## Things I want to know more about

1. How do you know exaclty what will be changed in state?
2. What other ways can I be sure to practice static web applciations?
