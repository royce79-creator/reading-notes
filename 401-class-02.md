# Reading Notes 02

- Writing tests are improtant to testign whether code may work or not. Called TDD.
- Module name should follow the same ruling as the file name. For example, gender.py -> test_gender.py
- Belows is an example of file structure.
```
mymodule/
 — module.py
 — another_folder/
 — — another_module.py
tests/
 — test_module.py
 — another_folder/
 — — test_another_module.py
 ```

### Using the three AAA's
- Arrange: you need to organize the data needed to execute that piece of code (input).
- Act: here you will execute the code being tested (exercise the behaviour). 
- Assert: after executing the code, you will check if the result (output) is the same as you were expecting.

### Time for the Cycle
- Make sure to test your code and see it fail, usually if you can get it done on the first try then there is bound to be some sort of mistake.
- Write the feature and implement a test to see if the code works. 
- Refactor your code to make it look better and more easier to read. 

## Takeaways from Article
The greatest advantage about TDD is to craft the software design first
Your code will be more reliable: after a change you can run your tests and be in peace
Beginning may be hard — and that’s fine. You just need to practice!

## What does __name__ == '__main__'

- Utilizes an interpreter in order to read the main gate, A module is the file name with the .py forming after the file name. 
```
print ("Always executed")
 
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print ("Executed when invoked directly")
else:
    print ("Executed when imported")
```
- This example code will only run if the program enter through the module if it is the netry point.
- You can chekc if it is running from the module. 
- Using the method above is better sicne it allows us to use the code as a standalone module rather than going through any other imports.

## Recursion
- Recursion is the way of a callign a fucntion directly or indirectly. Utilizing a fucntion that will cal itself without needing to do any additional function calling. 
- Within doing recursion it makes it easier to use fucntions and have them continue till you want the algorithm to break. 
```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
 
// Factorial function
int f(int n)
{
    // Stop condition
    if (n == 0 || n == 1)
        return 1;
 
    // Recursive condition
    else
        return n * f(n - 1);
}
 
// Driver code
int main()
{
    int n = 5;
    cout<<"factorial of "<<n<<" is: "<<f(n);
    return 0;
}
```
