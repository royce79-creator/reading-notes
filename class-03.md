# Reading Notes for Class 03

## Chapter 3 Lists: (pg 62-73)
- Lists are super improtant to be able to have on your sites. They help with organizing a lot of your things on a page either from ordered or to unordered lists. 

**Ordered Lists**
- Below is an example of what a list would look like if you were to use the tage below for "ol" and "li": 
```
<ol>
    <li>When making bread you need the ingredients.</li>
    <li>Then you will need to know how to bake.</li>
    <li>Finnally be able to eat the bread.</li>
</ol> 
```

**Unordered Lists** 
- In this unordered lists are great when it comes to making sure that it is used in bullet point format usally through "ul" and "li": 
```
<ul>
    <li>I have to go to the bank today</li>
    <li>Have to grab food</li>
    <li>Need to grab pet supplies</li>
</ul>
```
**Definition Lists**
- "dl" is the contatiner that houses all the definitons of the list you're creating. "dt" refers to the contained term that will be defined. Then Finally with "dd" this will refer to the actual definition.

**Nested Lists**
- Nested lists can be within another list to highlight some item that are within a listed item. For example: 
```
<ul>
    <li>bread</li>
    <li>cookies</li>
    <li>pastries
        <li>croissant</li>
        <li>creme brulee</li>
        <li>scone</li>
    </li>
</ul>
```

## Chapter 13 Boxes: (pg 300-329)
**How Boxes are**
- Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
- Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
- Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
- Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

**Limiting Width**
- The min-width property defines the minimum width of an element.
If the content is smaller than the minimum width, the minimum width will be applied.
If the content is larger than the minimum width, the min-width property has no effect.

**Limiting Height**
- The max-height property defines the maximum height of an element.
If the content is larger than the maximum height, it will overflow. How the container will handle the overflowing content is defined by the overflow property.
If the content is smaller than the maximum height, the max-height property has no effect.
- The min-height property defines the minimum height of an element.
If the content is smaller than the minimum height, the minimum height will be applied.
If the content is larger than the minimum height, the min-height property has no effect.

**Overflow**
- The overflow property specifies what should happen if content overflows an element's box. This property specifies whether to clip content or to add scrollbars when an element's content is too big to fit in a specified area.

**Border, Margin, Padding** 
- Super important for getting different colors to meld with the boxed texts that you are trying to make.
