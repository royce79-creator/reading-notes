# Introduction to React and Components

## Component Based Architecture

**What is a component?**
1. A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

2. A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.

3. A software component can be defined as a unit of composition with a contractually specified interface and explicit context dependencies only. That is, a software component can be deployed independently and is subject to composition by third parties.

**What are the charactistics of a component?**

- Reusability − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

- Replaceable − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

- Not context specific − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

- Extensible − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

- Encapsulated − A A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

- Independent − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

**What are the advantages of using component based architecture?**

- Ease of deployment − As new compatible versions become available, it is easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.

- Reduced cost − The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.

- Ease of development − Components implement well-known interfaces to provide defined functionality, allowing development without impacting other parts of the system.

- Reusable − The use of reusable components means that they can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.

- Modification of technical complexity − A component modifies the complexity through the use of a component container and its services.

- Reliability − The overall system reliability increases since the reliability of each individual component enhances the reliability of the whole system via reuse.

- System maintenance and evolution − Easy to change and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.

- Independent − Independency and flexible connectivity of components. Independent development of components by different group in parallel. Productivity for the software development and future software development.

## What is Props and How to Use it in React

**What is props short for?**
- Props is short for *properties* in React, and is used to pass data from one component to another.

**How are props used in React?**
- Props are used using what seems to be inerpolation which helps with passing data from the parent component to the children.
- You will also need to use dot notation to invoke this so that it will render out the text property with interpolation.
- Props are being passed to components like function arguments.

**Example of using interpolation and dot notation:**

```
const ChildComponent = (props) => {  
  return <p>{props.text}</p>; 
};
```

**What is the flow of props?**
- The flow goes in a uni-directional flow, a one way from parent to child.
- The flow heps with getting from paretn to child and is then executed to a final product.
