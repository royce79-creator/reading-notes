- The <table> tag defines an HTML table.
Each table row is defined with a ```<tr>``` tag. Each table header is defined with a ```<th>``` tag. Each table data/cell is defined with a ```<td>``` tag.
By default, the text in ```<th>``` elements are bold and centered.
By default, the text in ```<td>``` elements are regular and left-aligned.

to create a table.
- ```<tr>```: You indicate the start of each
row using the opening ```<tr>``` tag.
- ```<td>```: Each cell of a table is represented using a ```<td>``` element. (The td stands for
table data.)
