## Classes & Objects:
- Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get variables and functions from classes. 
- Here is an example of what a class loosk like: 
```
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")
```

### Accessing Object Variables
- When accessing variables inside of a class you can ude dot notation to do so. for example: 
```
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobjectx = MyClass()

myobjectx.variable
```
### Accessing Object Functions
- To access a function inside of an object you would also use dot notation. For example: 
```
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobjectx = MyClass()

myobjectx.function()
```

## Thinking Recursively
- Santa claus example: douse 1 -> house 2 -> house 3. This would be an example fo an iterative algorithm
```
houses = ["Eric's house", "Kenny's house", "Kyle's house", "Stan's house"]

def deliver_presents_iteratively():
    for house in houses:
        print("Delivering presents to", house)
```
- The elf example: there is worker elves and manager elves that end up giving this work down the line and making it recursive. 
```
houses = ["Eric's house", "Kenny's house", "Kyle's house", "Stan's house"]

# Each function call represents an elf doing his work 
def deliver_presents_recursively(houses):
    # Worker elf doing his work
    if len(houses) == 1:
        house = houses[0]
        print("Delivering presents to", house)

    # Manager elf doing his work
    else:
        mid = len(houses) // 2
        first_half = houses[:mid]
        second_half = houses[mid:]

        # Divides his work among two elves
        deliver_presents_recursively(first_half)
        deliver_presents_recursively(second_half)
```

## Recursive functions in Python
- When using recursive fucntions they wil call on themselves in order to repeat behaviors until conditions are met to return a result. two things that are always apart of recursive functions: base case and recursive case.
