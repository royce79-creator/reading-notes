# Learning Markdown! 

## What is markdown and how does it work? 
- Markdown is a language that is primarily used for light weight text editing within text editors. 
- What's really cool is this page is all done because of markdown so when you see this text this was actually done within makrdown. 

## Some Markdown Syntax 
What you see here is some header in a markdown format. 
```
# This is an <h1> tag
## This is an <h2> tag
###### This is an <h6> tag
``` 
## Emphasis
This example below is showing how the syntax would like when you put emphasis to your words. 
```
*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_
```
## Lists
Ever wanted to list things out but not have them in any ordered list? Well below would be similar syntax to have that done!
```
Unordered
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b
Ordered
1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   1. Item 3b
```
## Images
Everyone wants images to looks at when they visit a page, so if you want to insert images into you page all you need to do is follow the syntax below.

## Blockquotes
``` 
As Kanye West said:

> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.
Inline code
I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.
```

### Tables
- This is a way to make tables in your markdown. Really useful when trying to compare things in you pages. 
```
| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |
```
